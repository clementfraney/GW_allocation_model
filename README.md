# GW_allocation_model
This repository contains the data files and the model that I have built during my master thesis at the Technical University of Denmark.
The topic of the master thesis is:
**Optimizing Groundwater Allocation and Water Supply Infrastructure in the Capital Region of Denmark, Using Linear Programming.**

The repository contains the groundwater allocation optimization model, in the python file: *GW_allocation_model.py*.
The python script is using input data from the folders *Input data model* and *Shapefiles* and save results in the *Results* folder.

The repository also contains a guidance document (*Guidance_catchments_definition.docx*) for using the model with your own catchments if you wish to use different catchments than the ones I have used for my master thesis.
