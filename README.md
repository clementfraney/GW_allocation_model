# GW_allocation_model
This repository contains the data files and the model that I have built during my master thesis at the Technical University of Denmark.
The topic of the master thesis was:
Optimizing Groundwater Allocation and Water Supply Infrastructure in the Capital Region of Denmark, Using Linear Programming.

The repository contains the groundwater allocation optimization model, in the python file: "GW_allocation_model.py".
The python script is using input data from the folder "Input data model" and save results in the "Results" folder.

The repository also contains a guidance document (Guidance_catchments_definition.docx) for using the model with your own catchments if you wish to use different catchments than the ones I have used in my master thesis.
